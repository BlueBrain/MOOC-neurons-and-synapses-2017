TITLE AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptor with Stochastic Tsodyks-Markram dynamics

COMMENT
AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptor conductance using a dual-exponential profile
and with stochastic Tsodyks-Markram dynamics of the releasible pool.

This new model is based on Fuhrmann et al. 2002, and has the following properties:

1) No consumption on failure.  
2) No release just after release until recovery.
3) Same ensemble averaged trace as deterministic/canonical Tsodyks-Markram 
   using same parameters determined from experiment.

The synapse is implemented as a uni-vesicular (generalization to
multi-vesicular should be straight-forward) 2-state Markov process.
The states are {1=recovered, 0=unrecovered}.

For a pre-synaptic spike or external spontaneous release trigger
event, the synapse will only release if it is in the recovered state,
and with probability Use (which follows facilitation dynamics).  If it
releases, it will transition to the unrecovered state.  Recovery is as
a Poisson process with rate 1/tau_rec.
