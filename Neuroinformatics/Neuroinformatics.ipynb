    "### Description of the task\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the greatest challenges in neuroscience is to make the data available to the scientific community using data standards and ontologies to make data searchable and promote its reusability.  The complexity of neuroscience data comes not only from the different scales of the data produced, ranging from single cell to organ, but also from the lack of a consensus in the use and production of data standards and ontologies. \n",
    "In this task, we would like that you place yourself into the role of the scientist who wants to submit some of the data produced by the Laboratory of Neural Microcircuitry (LNMC) into the Blue Brain Nexus Platform where it can be shared with other scientists.\n",
    "You will be provided with a description of the methods that were used to generate electrophysiological traces and a morphology reconstruction from a pyramidal cell of the somatosensory cortex of a rat (see below under ‘Methods section’). This experiment has been carried out to define the morphological and electrical type of the neuron. Your task will be to register the corresponding data through the Provenance Editor using the domain, ontologies and provenance model that were designed in the last video lectures of week 2.\n",

    "**Disclaimer**: The information in this section is derived from the protocols being currently used at LNMC of the EPFL to generate their electrophysiology traces and morphology reconstructions (ref. 1-3). The cell ontology used has been directly derived from the work done at the LNMC and Blue Brain Project (ref. 4). \n",

    "__Summary__:<br/>\n",
    "In-vitro experiments performed on neurons require the use of a brain sample that is extracted from an animal. In this experiment, the brain slice was obtained from a rat brain. A neuron was chosen in the brain slice to perform electrophysiology recordings and a morphology reconstruction. For electrophysiology experiments, an electrode is used to inject current into the neuron to evoke action potentials. These experiments are useful to define the electrical properties of the neuron. The morphology reconstruction experiments require the staining of the neuron, in this protocol, biocytin is used for staining. It is used to reveal what form the neuron has, where the soma is located and to characterize the dendritic and axonal arborisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Introduction__:<br/>\n",
    "Pyramidal cells (PCs) are key neurons providing output signals from the neocortex. The superficial cortical layers 2/3 PCs project to the contralateral hemisphere via the corpus callosum while the deeper layer 5 PCs project mainly to subcortical targets. Layer 5 thick tufted PCs (TTPCs) are a subtype of PCs, they have a big soma and a thick apical dendrite forming tuft dendrites in layer 1 and their axons project to the tectum, brainstem and the spinal cord. They are the most extensively studied neuron type in the mammalian neocortex and have become a benchmark for understanding information processing in excitatory neurons. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Specimen__:<br/>\n",
    "Male rats of the strain Wistar Han and aged postnatal day 14 (P14) were used for the morphological and electrophysiology analysis of layer 5 TTPC neurons. The output of this study will help us define what the morphology-type and the electrical-type of one neuron is. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Protocol: Slice extraction and neuron selection for electrophysiology experiments__<br/> \n",
    "After extraction from the rat skull, brains were quickly dissected and sliced into 300 µm-thick coronal slices (HR2 vibratome, Sigmann Elektronik, Germany) in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), followed by a 15 minute incubation at 34°C in standard ACSF.\n",
    "Neurons in the slices were visualized using infrared __differential interference contrast microscopy__ (VX55 camera, Till Photonics, Germany and BX51WI microscope, Olympus, Japan) and a neuron was selected for further experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Protocol: Electrophysiology recording of single neuron__<br/>\n",
    "__Whole-cell patch__ clamp recordings were performed at 32 +/- 1°C in a standard ACSF solution with an Axon Multiclamp 700B Amplifier (Molecular Devices, USA) using 2 – 10 MOhm borosilicate pipettes, containing (in mM): K+-gluconate 110.00, KCl 10.00, ATP-Mg2+ 4.00, Na2-phosphocreatine 10.00, GTP-Na+ 0.30, HEPES 10.00, biocytin 3.00 mg/ml; pH 7.30, 300 mOsm. The patched neuron was submitted to an __IDRest__ current injection protocol (see fig 1). After analysis of the traces, the electrical type (__e-type__) was determined.\n",

    "In the IDRest protocol the experimenter determines a hyperpolarizing offset current to keep the cell at -70 mV (before liquid junction potential correction) and applies this current during the entire protocol. After an initial period of 700 ms, a step current was applied for 2000 ms, and after the step, a final period of 300 ms is recorded. This protocol is repeated with different step currents normalized to the threshold current (i.e. the lowest current that generates one action potential during the step) (ref. 4)._\n",

    "After the electrophysiological recording and overnight fixation of the slice in 2% PFA + 0.3% picric acid + 1% glutaraldehyde, the __biocytin-filled__ neuron was revealed with __3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB)__ staining. Next, each cell was reconstructed in 3D under an Olympus BX51W microscope with an oil-immersion 100x (NA 1.35) objective using Neurolucida software (MicroBrightField, Magdeburg, Germany).  The reconstructed neuron underwent quantitative analysis using NeuroExplorer (MicroBrightField). The quantitative morphometric analysis is based on multiple parameters derived from the dendrites and axons of reconstructed neuron. The staining procedure results in ~25% shrinkage of the slice thickness and ~10% anisotropic shrinkage along the x and y axes. After analysis of the morphologies, the morphology type (__m-type__) was determined.\n",
